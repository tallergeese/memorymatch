# Memory Match - Version 0.1 (v0.1)

#### Overview

> This version is used to reinforce HTML, CSS & layout concepts to put your own flare into a classic game of 
concentration. The scope for this version asks the student to choose a theme for the game including: 

> - 9 card faces
> - 1 card back
> - Creating an about page describing about the game and the skills that went into creating it.

> This version will integrate with instructor built JavaScript to give the layout built by the student's functionality 
and show the ability of design & layout to be independent of functionality but strict requirements are needed 
(specific classes and id’s). In future versions the students will be building out the same functionality that is 
provided with each student providing their own flare and features. The students will pull the knowledge from what 
they have learned from the resources they have consumed and the prototypes they have completed and pull it into one 
cohesive version of this project.

# Memory Match - Version 0.5 (v0.5)

#### Overview
> Version 0.5 is where we combine the basic JS skills we learned through the presentations & prototypes and apply it towards the v0.1 HTML structure. We will be adding the basic functionality to match cards as they are clicked and determine if the game is won by the user.

> For this version we will be breaking down the programmatic flow and explaining the decisions that the program has to make to fully understand how the user is interacting. As we move further into the program we will be showing less and less of the flow and expect a certain level of understanding of logical flow. The diagram below should help you follow along with the bullet points.

# Memory Match

### Overview

> Version 1.0 continues where version 0.5 stopped by adding in the statistics of the memory match game. When a user clicks on a card the application will start tracking how many matches versus how many attempts. In combination with the stats there is also a tracker for how many times the game is played. Games played is tracked by resetting / restarting the game.

### Scope

>- Adding Stats
    - Declare a global variable, `matches`, and set it to 0
        - Every time the application finds a match this variable should be incremented by 1
    - Declare a global variable, `attempts`, and set it to 0
        - Every time a user attempts a match (clicks the 2nd card) the attempts should be incremented by 1
    - Declare a global variable, `accuracy`, and set it to 0
        - Accuracy is defined as a percentage of matches / attempts
    - Declare a global variable, `games_played` and set it to 0
        - When the page is loaded a new global variable should be defined called games_played. When the game is reset by clicking the reset button the games_played should be incremented by 1.
    - Declare a function, `display_stats`, that has the following functionality
        - Inserts the **games_played** value into the element that would be selected like this “.games-played .value”
        - Insert **attempts** value into the element that would be selected using this selector “.attempts .value”
        - Formats **accuracy** to be a percentage number with the **%** sign
        - Takes formatted **accuracy** and inserts the value of the variable into the element that has the selector of “.accuracy .value”
    - Declare a function, `reset_stats`, that has the following functionality
        - Resets variable **accuracy** to 0
        - Resets variable **matches** to 0
        - Resets variable **attempts** to 0
        - Calls **display_stats** function
    - On **Reset button** click, the function handler for the click event should have the following functionality
        - increment games_played by 1
        - call reset_stats
        - call display_stats
        - Reset all cards to have the back face showing
