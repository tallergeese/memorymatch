# Memory Match - Version 0.1 (v0.1)

#### Overview

> This version is used to reinforce HTML, CSS & layout concepts to put your own flare into a classic game of 
concentration. The scope for this version asks the student to choose a theme for the game including: 

> - 9 card faces
> - 1 card back
> - Creating an about page describing about the game and the skills that went into creating it.

> This version will integrate with instructor built JavaScript to give the layout built by the student's functionality 
and show the ability of design & layout to be independent of functionality but strict requirements are needed 
(specific classes and id’s). In future versions the students will be building out the same functionality that is 
provided with each student providing their own flare and features. The students will pull the knowledge from what 
they have learned from the resources they have consumed and the prototypes they have completed and pull it into one 
cohesive version of this project.

# Memory Match - Version 0.5 (v0.5)

#### Overview
> Version 0.5 is where we combine the basic JS skills we learned through the presentations & prototypes and apply it towards the v0.1 HTML structure. We will be adding the basic functionality to match cards as they are clicked and determine if the game is won by the user.

> For this version we will be breaking down the programmatic flow and explaining the decisions that the program has to make to fully understand how the user is interacting. As we move further into the program we will be showing less and less of the flow and expect a certain level of understanding of logical flow. The diagram below should help you follow along with the bullet points.

>   - jQuery - Intermediate
>       - Add click method to a jQuery Selector with the parameter equal to a function called card_clicked
>   - onclick attribute - Fundamentals

>   - **second_card_clicked** assigned to null
>   - **total_possible_matches** assign to number of total possible matches (in this case 2)
>   - **match_counter** assigned to 0
> - Declare card_clicked function in the script.js file with the following functionality in it
>   - Show the card face
